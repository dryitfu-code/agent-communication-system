# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agent Communication System. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Devin CLI adapter** — `adapter: "devin"` runs `devin -p <brief>
  --permission-mode dangerous` (plus `--resume` and `--model` when set). Devin
  has no per-run MCP flag, so its harness declares `mcp: false`: the
  supervisor claims the task and submits the printed answer. The provider
  catalog gains a `cognition` entry. Not run against a real Devin account.
- **Claude Code wake hook** — `qagent hook claude-code` runs as a background
  `Stop` hook with `asyncRewake`: when mail arrives for the agent it exits 2,
  which wakes an idle interactive Claude Code session and shows Claude the new
  messages' headers. It only peeks, announces each message once, and a newer
  copy for the same agent replaces the older one. `--settings` prints the
  `.claude/settings.json` snippet. New read-only `Bus.unreadAfter`. TypeScript
  build only.
- **Benchmark runner** (`bench/`) — runs a fixed task set (14 implementation
  tasks with frozen validators, 6 research tasks with frozen truth) against a
  roster on a fresh bus and clone, and reports acceptance, first-round
  acceptance, defect escape, cross-family review, stuck time, human touches,
  cost and coordination overhead per arm. `node bench/run.mjs baseline --mini`
  starts a real run (see `bench/README.md`); `--fake` runs the same scoring
  and reporting on the fake harness, which CI does. No new dependencies; the
  fake harness now handles `[TASK #n]` mail and can submit scripted reports.
- **Numbered schema migrations** — the bus schema now lives in ordered files
  under `schema/` (`001-baseline.sql` is the exact schema of 0.2.0) and
  `meta.schema_version` is the highest applied number. Pending migrations run
  in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction on open; existing version-1 buses open
  unchanged. A database written by a newer schema is now refused with an
  "upgrade qagent" error instead of having its version marker overwritten
  (read-only opens still work); binaries from before this change keep the old
  overwrite behaviour. Migrations are additive only. TypeScript build only:
  the Rust port still carries its own copy of the baseline schema.
- **Per-task git worktrees** — `qagent task claim --worktree` (and
  `bus_task_claim` with `worktree: true`) gives the task its own checkout on
  branch `qagent/task-<N>-<id>` under `~/.agent-bus/worktrees/`;
  `qagent task worktree <N> [--remove]` and `task worktree prune` manage them.
  With `"isolation": "worktree"` the supervisor runs single-task turns for a
  claimed task inside that checkout and resumes a per-task CLI session.
  TypeScript build only: the Rust port ignores `"isolation": "worktree"` and
  has no `--worktree` flag or `task worktree` command; the bus schema is
  unchanged, so both builds still share one bus.
- **Stalled-task detection** — claims whose assignee went quiet are listed by
  `qagent task stalled`; `qagent task requeue` returns a task to the pool;
  `qagent supervise --auto-requeue-min <n>` requeues dead claims automatically.
- **`qagent trace <id>`** — a task's full causal chain (events, notes, task
  mail) in one timeline, as text, `--format json`, or a self-contained HTML
  export via `--export`.
- **`qagent supervise --roster`** — runs every roster agent from one
  supervisor process; a dead sibling no longer orphans the rest.
- **Registry manifests** — `server.json`, `glama.json`, `smithery.yaml` for
  MCP-registry submission, plus `docs/submission-pack.md`.
- **Demo + docs** — `acs` TUI demo GIF in the README, competitive analysis,
  promotion playbook, standout-features list, launch copy, and a full
  marketing strategy with a 30-day calendar.

### Changed

- **Efficiency pass** — cached prepared statements on hot paths, batched
  dashboard delta reads (`agentSummaries`, `messageSummaries`), indexed
  router lookups, cheaper idle waits, narrower auto-claim candidate reads.
- **npm packaging** — `private` removed, `files` whitelist (~129 KB tarball),
  `publishConfig`, `prepack` build, `repository` and `mcpName` metadata;
  the README install section is written for the post-publish state; until the
  first publish it leads with clone, `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm link`.

### Fixed

- `qagent` no longer prints Node's `node:sqlite` ExperimentalWarning on every
  command; other warnings still print.
- `docs/free-ai-setup.md` now builds a config that validates: it says the
  supervisor reads `<project>/.qagent/config.json` (started from a copy of the
  shipped `agent-bus.config.json`) and adds the provider and harness entries its
  models refer to. It and `docs/provider-support.md` no longer say that
  `qagent doctor` scans for providers, prints login commands or checks logins.
- Worktree creation no longer blocks on a stale lock: a lock whose holder
  died, never wrote its owner file, or stopped heartbeating (pid reuse) is
  swept. Worktree cleanup (`task worktree --remove`, `prune`) now works after
  the task's project directory is deleted; if the whole repository is gone the
  orphaned checkout is deleted with `--force`.
- README and docs no longer claim what the code does not back: the install
  section leads with clone-and-build (the package is not on npm yet), review is
  described as "by someone other than the assignee" (the gate does not check
  model family), the `acs` TUI is labelled as the `rust-port` branch's, the
  adapter list matches `ADAPTERS`, and the competitive analysis now includes
  Hermes Agent. `npm run audit:public` also runs `scripts/check-readme-claims.mjs`.
- `tests/wait-notify.test.ts` no longer fails on one slow wake-up under load:
  the `bus_wait` test holds the median of five rounds to the bound, the signal-file test
  asserts against the poll interval, and a fake-clock test pins the poll bound.
- Expired claims can be released and requeued; a batch of expired claims
  requeues correctly after the mid-batch expiry sweep; the auto-requeue
  sweep no longer eats live claims.
- `public-release-audit` accepts an exact-address `allowedEmails` whitelist
  (the published SECURITY.md contact) — main's CI is green again.
- Claim-race test no longer crashes the suite on an expected child-stdin
  EPIPE.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-30

Tagged on GitHub as `v0.2.0`; not yet published to npm.

### Added

- **Bus core** — durable agent identities, addressed mail, task lifecycle
  (create → assign → claim → submit → review → release), atomic claims,
  path leases, claim expiry, and a full event log — all in one SQLite
  file with no daemon.
- **`qagent` CLI** — init, agent/identity management, send/inbox/ack/wait,
  task add/list/show/claim/note/submit/review/release/cancel, deps, leases,
  status, log, doctor, import, mcp-config.
- **MCP stdio server** — the bus as agent tools (send, inbox, wait, task
  ops) plus operator tools; `qagent mcp-config` writes provider configs.
- **Supervisor + harness adapters** — launches real agent CLIs (Claude Code,
  Codex, Gemini, Kimi, OpenCode, Grok, Hermes, Cursor, generic command
  adapter), routes tasks by role/capability, brief injection, progress
  tracking, API-key sanitization in child environments.
- **Dashboard** — localhost operator console (agents, tasks, message stream)
  with single-use sign-in tickets and SSE live updates.
- **Docs** — README, FULL-GUIDE, V2-DESIGN, architecture, provider-support,
  security, and `free-ai-setup.md` (zero-cost team on Gemini free tier /
  OpenCode Zen / Ollama / OpenRouter, with a recommended all-free preset).

### Fixed

- Change polling stays responsive after early file events.
- CI test scheduling stabilized.
